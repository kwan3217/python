Spice kernel covering the natural objects in the Kerbol system.

This file is used to generate a kernel roughly equivalent to DE430 for the
real solar system, but including all planets (including dwarf planets) and
moons.

Object numbering is not Spice-like, but instead follows the numbering in

The K0001 epoch (equivalent to J2000) is used, as this matches the in-game
time scale. The clock ticks at 1 SI second per second, and starts at Y1D1T00:00:00 UT
