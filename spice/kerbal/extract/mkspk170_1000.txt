Spice kernel covering the natural objects in the Kerbol system. This segment
is for the position of Kerbol system barycenter (Spice ID 1000) relative to Inertial Origin (Spice ID 0)
and uses a constant zero vector offset.

Using data from spreadsheet, extracted from KSP version 1.7.0

The K0001 epoch (equivalent to J2000) is used, as this matches the in-game
time scale. The clock ticks at 1 SI second per second, and starts at 
Year 1, Day 1, 00:00:00 UT which is the exact instant that the game starts
and matches all UT in seconds in the persistence file.
