Spice kernel covering the natural objects in the Kerbol system. This segment
is for the position of Dres (Spice ID 1599) relative to Dres Barycenter (Spice ID 1005)
and uses a constant zero vector offset.

Using data from spreadsheet, extracted from KSP version 1.8.1

The K0001 epoch (equivalent to J2000) is used, as this matches the in-game
time scale. The clock ticks at 1 SI second per second, and starts at 
Year 1, Day 1, 00:00:00 UT which is the exact instant that the game starts
and matches all UT in seconds in the persistence file.
