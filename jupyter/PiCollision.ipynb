    "3blue1brown issued a challenge to all of us to understand why the collision of objects results in calculating $\\pi$ (pi). The guy at Coding Train did it as one of his challenges, but while I was watching it, I was amazed by how accurate he was able to get it, considering that he used Euler integration. Finally it occurred to me that he wasn't tracking accurately at *all* where the objects were, at least not accurately enough to matter. \n",
    "\n",
    "His collision detection just checked whether the objects overlapped. So, in one step, the two blocks overlap, but they must overlap by less than the relative motion of the blocks over one step, because if it were more, they would have overlapped in the previous step. The collision and reflection is then guaranteed to get them to not overlap in the next step, because the blocks relative motion is reversed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more I thought about it, the more it became obvious that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *We don't have to track position at all* - because the small block is trapped. It is either moving towards the wall and will hit the wall (the big block will never move faster towards the wall than the small block), it is moving away from the wall faster than the big block, in which case it will hit it, or moving away from the wall slower than the big block, in which case it will never hit and we can stop counting.\n",
    "* *We don't have to track time at all* - It is always obvious from the cases above what will happen next, and the physics are invariant over time and space so it doesn't matter when and where it happens.\n",
