    "I don't like the way numpy vector operations work, so I will implement my own, based on numpy element operations and total. All of these will work on stacks of vectors, where the first index indicates the vector component. If you want a 1D group of vectors, you want a 2D numpy array, where each column is a vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "As is customary for doing numerical work in interpreted languages, we want to be able to do operations on as large of arrays as possible without using an interpreted loop. In numpy as in IDL, we do this by doing array operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequently in order to have as large of an array as possible, we wil *stack* together vectors. We mostly use column vectors, so a 1D stack of vectors is a 2D array, where each column is one vector. A 1D stack of 2D matrices is a 3D array. We can imagine higher-dimension stacks easily -- if you have an nD stack of m-rank tensor objects, you need a (n+m)D numpy array. However, numpy itself doesn't have any concept of stacks and ranks, so you have to manually keep track of which array index is for the stack and which is for the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "One inconvenient thing about array indexing in numpy is that it seems to be hard to make consistent. A 1D array of course only has one index. A row vector is a 2D array of size (1,n) while a column vector (most of the time we use column vectors) has size (n,1). Numpy doesn't make it easy to compose 1D vectors, row vectors, and/or column vectors, so they will usually have to be explicitly resized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, if you have a stack of column vectors, it ends up being in the form (vector component, stack index). This is fine, because it exactly matches the form of a matrix. This is especially convenient when we want to transform a stack of vectors $[\\mathbf{X}]=\\begin{bmatrix}\\vec{x}_0 & \\vec{x}_1 & ... & \\vec{x}_{n-1}\\end{bmatrix}$ with a matrix $[\\mathbf{A}]$ all at once: Just do a matrix multiply $[\\mathbf{A}][\\mathbf{X}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where things get inconsistent is higher dimensional stacks of vectors, or stacks of matrices. For a 1D stack of matrices, the indexes are (stack index, row index, column index). For a 2D stack of column vectors, we would have (stack1 index, vector component, stack0 index) (to keep things consistent with matrices). So, for vectors, the first stack index is the last index, but for matrices, all stack indexes are before the row and column indexes. For higher dimensional stacks of vectors, the first stack index is the last index, but all the other stack indexes come before the vector component index. This is mandated by how the `@` operator (implemented by [`numpy.matmul`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html)) treats indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a 1D stack of vectors with a total array shape of (n_comp,n_stack), we say the shape of the stack is (n_stack,). For a 2D stack of shape (n_stack0,n_comp,n_stack1), the stack shape is (n_stack0,n_stack1). For higher order stacks (n_stack0,n_stack1,...,n_stackn-1,n_comp,n_stackn) the stack shape is (n_stack0,n_stack1,n_stackn-1,n_stackn). Functions `vdot()`, `vlength()`, and `vangle()` which naturally take vector arguments and return scalars will return a stack of scalars, IE if you pass an nD stack of vectors (a numpy (n+1)D array), you will get a stack of scalars, IE a numpy nD array.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the complexity in these functions is just with dealing with stacks."
