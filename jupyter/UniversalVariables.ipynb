The parameter $\\mu$ or its powers is almost always used as a multiplicative constant. Therefore in any formula involving $\\mu$, setting $\\mu=1$ is equivalent to just cancelling it out.\n",

    "The length of a DU is arbitrary, but is customarily the radius of the central body for planets and moons, and 1 AU for the Sun. Once the length of a DU is decided and the $\\mu$ of the central object is known in some standard system of units (like SI), the duration of a TU is determined.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we shall see, many of the documented math formulas have an explicit $\\mu$ term, but most often in the code, the parameters are translated from standard physical units to canonical units at the top of the function, and translated back at the bottom, so that the hard part in the middle doesn't have `mu` at all.
