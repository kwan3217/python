    "## Complex Numbers\n",
    "To start off with, we have complex numbers. Aggressively ignoring [history](https://omoikane.kwansystems.org/wiki/index.php/History), we present the concept in basically its modern form. The product of any two negative numbers is positive, so no real number is the square root of a negative number. So, we invent the concept of imaginary numbers. The imaginary unit $i$ is created out of thin air, and to begin with, it's most important property is $i^2=-1$ or taking the square root of both sides, $i=\\sqrt{-1}$. Any time you have a negative number $-a$ under a square root you can always factor it $\\sqrt{-a}=\\sqrt{(-1)a}=\\sqrt{-1}\\sqrt{a}=i\\sqrt{a}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's amazing how far we can run with this simple definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, real numbers and imaginary numbers can be added to produce complex numbers, but you can't simplify the addition. If you add the real number $3$ to the imaginary number $4i$, the best you can do is $3+4i$. You can treat $i$ as an unknown variable and do math with it, and thereby obtain the addition and multiplication rules. The interesting one is multiplication as we will see here:\n",

    "## Polar notation for complex numbers\n",
    "We learned that any complex number can be geometrically interpreted as a point in the complex plane, with its $x$ coordinate given by the coefficient of the real part, and the $y$ coordinate as the coefficient of the imaginary part. We also learned that it is often useful to express these points in polar form, especially when we are multiplying two complex numbers. It's pretty common to see a complex number expressed as $(r\\angle \\theta)$, especially when this polar form is first introduced. This way we don't have to explain how to transform from rectangular to polar. But how do we? If we have a number in this form, how do we get the rectangular form? Trigonometry, of course.\n",
    "\n",
    "We treat the complex plane as just a regular old 2D plane, with a real axis and an imaginary axis. Using the definitions of sine and cosine, we can say that if we have a number $(r\\angle \\theta)$ and want to convert it to rectangular form $x+iy$, we can just say that $x=r \\cos \\theta$ and $y=r \\sin \\theta$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now the fun begins. If you have a point on a plane, you can express it in rectangular coordinates like we have above, or in polar coordinates, where instead of real and imaginary parts, you have the magnitude, the distance from the origin, and the argument, the angle from the +x axis to the segment from the origin to the point.\n",

    "Another completely independent way to discover this identity is with differential equations. First the exponential function is defined on positive whole numbers using repeated multiplication, negative numbers with inverse, rational numbers as powers of roots, and then the continuous exponential function at any irrational number is *defined* as the limiting value of the output for a sequence of rational numbers that converges on the desired irrational input. Usually it is proven that the exponential function (defined as the continuous function through all the rational exponents) is its own derivative:\n",
