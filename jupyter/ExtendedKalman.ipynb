However, for down-to-earth things like robots, the physics are usually too complicated to integrate directly. One of the things our filter will do for us is integrate numerically, so that we end up with (in principle) a list of times and the state vector for each time. This will be our trajectory function."

    "\n",
    "First, most physical processes are smooth. No discontinuities and no corners. Just nice sweeping curves. If you look at any of these curves closely enough, the relative radius of curvature gets bigger and bigger, and any small section eventually appears linear if you zoom in on it enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to take advantage of this, you have to look at the right part of a curve. We need a reasonably accurate initial condition and a correct dynamics and kinematics model. Now we can use the derivative of the curve to find the general direction of motion. We use the initial condition estimate and model to create a reference trajectory. We end up not estimating the trajectory $\\vec{x}(t)$ directly, but the deviation $\\vec{X}(t)$ from the reference $\\vec{x}_r(t)$ such that $\\vec{x}_r(t)+\\vec{X}(t)=\\vec{x}(t)$.\n",

We know the physics model (If we don't, go find it!) so we can use it directly on our old estimate with numerical integration. I'll talk in detail about numerical integration in another post, but if you are a programmer, there is a good chance you have already written one. The simplest one is this simple:\n",

    "Replacing $\\M A$ is a bit harder. For one thing, we don't even need the transition matrix for the reference trajectory, but that for the *deviation* of the state from the projected reference state. This deviation decidedly does not follow the same dynamics as the state -- the closest analogy I can think of is the [Clohessy–Wiltshire equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clohessy%E2%80%93Wiltshire_equations), which describe the relative motion of two objects which are near each other in a circular orbit around a much larger third body. These equations will often describe the \"orbit\" of one body around the other, even though the actual gravity between them is negligible, or sometimes even literally zero if one of the bodies is actually a target point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The point is, the dynamics of the state deviation are *spectacularly* not those of the state itself. Do not try to use the $\\M A$ matrix below to calculate the state transition of the reference state -- it might not even start off in the correct direction, even for arbitrarily small time steps. I wish I could assign a different symbol to it, but in the context of this problem, $\\M A$ makes sense since it fills the same job as in the linear filter, and there isn't a decorator which would make sense, since the name is already capitalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while the dynamics of $\\vec{X}$ and $\\vec{x}$ are *different*, they are *related*. Since if you add $\\vec{X}$ and $\\vec{x}_r$, you get the actual propagated trajectory $\\vec{x}$. Therefore, the uncertainty of $\\hat{\\vec{X}}$ is exactly the same as the uncertainty on $\\hat{\\vec{x}}$. You use the dynamics of the deviation $\\vec{X}$ to propagate the covariance $\\M P$, just as well as you could use the dynamics of $\\vec{x}$. However, as we will see below, it is easier to propagate the deviation dynamics $\\vec{X}$ in a way which is automatically derivable from the function $\\vec{F}(\\vec{x})$.\n",

    "Skipping all the justifications and derivations, you need a physics matrix $\\M \\Phi$. Finding it will require cranking out a bunch of derivatives by hand or computer, or writing a numerical differentiator. Then with $\\M \\Phi$ in hand, you can numerically integrate to get $\\M A$.

Instead of taking the derivative with respect to time as you may be accustomed to, you take the derivative of each component of the physics function with respect to each of the other components. You end up with a matrix, where for each cell, you have the derivative of the component that is this cell's row number, with respect to the component that is this cell's column number. If you want to, you can think of it as fitting tangent hyperplane to the physics function, in the same way that an ordinary derivative fits a tangent line to a 1D function. This hyperplane is flat, so this is why we call it \"linearized\". We then project this hyperplane out as far as we need it, and use it to transform an identity matrix from one place on the trajectory to $\\M A$ on another. The math is pretty straight forward, it's just hard to imagine, especially with more than about 1 element in your state vector.\n",

    "My first teacher for the Kalman filter talked about how the deviation could be maintained over multiple steps, so that we don't have to carry out the addition above, but if the deviation got too far away from the reference trajectory, the linear approximation would no longer be good enough and we would have to *rectify* the reference by actually doing the addition, resetting the deviation to zero, and I think resetting the deviation matrix to identity as well (If not rectifying, start the integration from where we left it last time). I never saw the point of not doing this addition each time (computational effort? Hard to justify given how much other work the filter does) and in a control loop, we need to do at least the addition each time. So, the code below will rectify after each measurement. My first teacher called this rectification at each step the *Extended Kalman filter*, as distinguished from the ordinary *Nonlinear Kalman filter* which maintained the deviation for more than one step. I haven't seen anyone else make this particular distinction."

    "# Extended Kalman Filter for linear velocity model\n",
    "\n",
    "Time for an example. We'll start really really simple, and just redo the linear velocity model.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, state vector. Basically the state vector is all the things that the system \"remembers\" about itself. Think about it as a simulation. Once we have a program, we run the simulation and freeze it at a certain point. What do we need to save so that when we restore, we have enough data to start the simulation back up? We'll use the cart on rails model as an example. We are working with a massive cart on smooth, level, perfectly frictionless rails. Therefore the cart is free to move in one dimension only. The very meaning of one dimension is that it takes only one number to describe the position, and we will call this number $p$. If we think of it as a function of time, we might say $p(t)$. We need $p$ in our state vector, but this does not yet completely describe the state. We also need to know the velocity. A cart at 4m down the track stopped is very different from a cart at 4m moving at 50m/s. As it turns out, this is all we need to know. This is all the cart \"remembers\" - everything else, such as our random gusts of wind, are instantaneous only. Any effect they have is only through changing the position and velocity. Therefore, $\\vec{x}=\\begin{bmatrix}p & v\\end{bmatrix}\\T$. Our state vector has two elements, $p$ (in units of meters from the origin, positive on one side and negative on the other) and $v$ (in units of meters per second, positive if moving one way and negative if the other).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, physics. We actually use Newton's first law here (normally problems start with the second law). The cart has no forces applied to it, so it continues in a straight line at constant speed. The derivative of the speed is zero (this is what constant speed means) and the derivative of the position is the speed, so we end up with this:\n",

    "An aside on vector notation. If the components of a vector $\\vec{?}$ are named, I will specify the element named $@$ by $?_@$ . If the components are ordered, and they always are, I will call the first component of $\\vec{?}$, $?_0$. If the vector already has a subscript such as $\\vec{?}_\\#$, we will call a component of it $?_{\\#,0}$. So, for our state vector $\\vec{x}$ above, we can talk about $x_p$, $x_v$, and note that $x_0=x_p$. We have to be careful with the notation -- while $x_0$ is a (scalar) component of vector $\\vec{x}$, we often notate the initial state as $\\vec{x}_0$. If we wanted to reference the position component of this initial state, we would write it as $x_{0,0}=x_{0p}$ Vector components always have an order, but sometimes it is more clear to talk about the components by name if any, so I will freely use both notations. When I get to it, I will number matrix cells with two indexes, row first, then column, starting at 0. If it is necessary for clarity, I will use a comma between the components. If the matrix is itself indexed, I will include the matrix index first, then the row index, then the column. So, the upper-left cell of any matrix $\\M ?$ is $?_{00}$, and the lower-left corner of a $99\\times 99$ matrix $\\MM{?}{_\\#}$ is $?_{\\#,98,0}$.\n",

In the upper left cell of the matrix, we take the derivative of the zero component of the force function $F_0(\\vec{x})=x_v$ with respect to the zero component of the state vector $x_p$ . Since this variable doesn't even occur in the formula, the derivative is zero and we have $\\Phi_{00}=0$. Next, in the upper right cell, we have component zero of the force function $F_0(\\vec{x})=x_v$ still, but this time we are going with respect to the 1 component of the state vector $x_1=x_v$. The derivative of any variable with respect to itself is 1, so we get $\\Phi_{01}=1$. Bottom left cell uses $F_1(\\vec{x})=0$ and $x_0=x_p$ so we have $\\Phi_{10}=0$.

You will note that we always need an initial guess of our state vector at step 0 $\\hat{x}_0$ as well as an initial guess of our uncertainty of our initial guess, $\\MM{P}{_0}$. For some problems, it doesn't matter so much what the initial guess is, since the filter converges rapidly. Sometimes, though, it doesn't, and when this happens, the filter gets farther and farther from the correct answer instead of closer, and we say that the filter diverges. If this happens in a real vehicle, the thing may diverge from its intended course and converge with a wall, causing the parts of the vehicle to diverge from each other. Let's agree right now not to diverge. Your filter can handle the truth, as much truth as you can give it. Give it as good of an initial guess as possible."
