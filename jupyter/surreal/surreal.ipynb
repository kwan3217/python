    "## Infinitesimal numbers\n",
    "Surreal numbers are a superset of the conventional definition of the real numbers. Not only is every real number present, there is also an infinite set of infinitesimal values, which to me is the interesting part of surreal numbers. I want to use them to do differential calculus without bothering with limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real numbers follow the [Archimedean property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_property). Given any two positive real numbers $a$ and $b$, you can find a finite positive integer $n$ such that $na>b$. In other words, you can \"stack\" enough copies of $a$ to reach the value of $b$. I specify positive numbers, because for $a=0$, there is no finite $n$ such that $n(0)>b$ for finite positive $b$. There is no number of zeros you can stack on top of each other to reach a nonzero number.\n",
    "\n",
    "An infinitesimal number is a number that does not have the Archimedean property. In the real numbers, only zero is infinitesimal. We often say that the real numbers have no infinitesimals, but what we mean is that there are no interesting, nonzero infinitesimals. Given one of these nonzero infinitesimals (we commonly use a symbol such as $\\epsilon$), there is no finite number $n$ such that $n\\epsilon>1$, or $n\\epsilon>a$ where $a$ is a positive finite real number. No matter how many copies of $\\epsilon$ you stack, you can't reach 1, or 0.1, or any finite real number, no matter how small the target is."

Specifically, the amount of information in a number scales with the generation-number of that number. For the interesting numbers (infinites and inifintesimals) as well as for many perfectly ordinary numbers like 1/3, there will be a literally infinite amount of information in the number, an infinitely tall tree of sets where all the leaves are the empty set. \n",

In general, for any number $x$, we will say that its sets are the left set $X_L$ and the right set $X_R$ (same letter only capitalized), and that the general members of these sets are $x_L\\in X_L$ and $x_R\\in X_R$. Similarly we will say $y=\\left<Y_L,Y_R\\right>$ with $y_L\\in Y_L$ and $y_R \\in Y_R$, and so on with any letter $a$-$z$.\n",

I can handle the $\\lnot$ in these definitions, but I would really like to get rid of the $\\ge$. Intuitively, we would think that if $a\\ge b$, then $b\\le a$.

    "## Equality, alikeness, and identity\n",
    "One of the things to be careful of is equality: Two surreal numbers $a$ and $b$ are equal if and only if both $a \\le b$ and $b \\le a$. Note that this does not imply that the sets composing $a$ and $b$ are equal, IE it is plausible two surreal numbers can have the same value, much as two rational numbers may have the same value, even though they have different numerators and denominators: $\\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{2}{4}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we have two notions of equality: One is the Python notion, where if two values compare equal with the `==` operator, they should have the same `hash()` value. This is required in order for things like sets to work, and we want sets to work because we are building these surreal numbers upon them. The other is the surreal equality implied by both $a \\le b$ and $b \\le a$ being true. In order to properly implement the `__eq__` operator, we need to either decide that two numbers with the same value are equal, and therefore must give the same hash, or are not, and therefore can't use `==`. If we do the first, it becomes impossible to put two different numbers with the same value into a set, equivalent to if we had rational numbers and tried to make a set out of $\\{1/2,2/4\\}$. If we do the second, it becomes impossible to say $1/2=2/4$. Instead we would have to say $1/2\\le 2/4$ and $2/4 \\le 1/2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what Alice and Bob mean by *similar to* or *like*, and once we get around to converting surreal numbers to real numbers, I anticipate that two surreal numbers which are alike will convert to the same real number. We define similarity ($=$ in math, `//` in code) as: Two numbers are alike only if each is less than or equal to the other, and they are not alike if this is not true. I haven't finished the book yet, but I haven't seen Alice and Bob refer to the other kind of equals, which I will refer to as *identity*, IE two numbers are identical if their left sets have the same members and their right sets have the same members. There won't be a single math symbol for identity -- if we need to refer to it, we will say $(X_L=Y_L)\\land(X_R=Y_R)$ where the $=$ sign there operates on two sets and therefore refers to set equality, not number equality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identity isn't quite the right word, either, since Python uses that word to mean two references to the same object in the same place in memory. However, I don't need that concept in surreal number math.\n",

    "     print(\"a and b are alike\")`\n",

Not all of these will be valid (for instance, any number with the same set on each side isn't. Rather than just throw these all at `__init__`, let's be systematic and see what the pattern of numbers look like. We will take the power set and make a table with 8 rows and 8 columns, each labeled by one element of the power set. It doesn't matter what order the power set is in, but since we have ordering, let's take the power set as an ordered list.\n"
