    "The best collection of papers on the net I have found is http://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/kalman/. From there, the best understandable explanation (from which much of this is derived) is SIGGRAPH2001_CoursePack_08.pdf by Welch and Bishop. The theory part mostly follows the references, especially CoursePack 08, but is in my own words, and describes my own understanding, insights, and sometimes lack of understanding. The example parts at the end are my own work.\n",

    "\n",
    "We will work with an uncontrolled system, one in which you have no influence on, and you are just trying to observe. For example, take my day job. I work with the EVE instrument on the SDO spacecraft. It observes the current flux of ultraviolet in a particular wavelength from the Sun. The EVE instrument is attempting to measure this, but nothing the SDO satellite (or mankind as a whole) does has any influence at all on what the Sun is actually doing. We can control how well EVE works, but in this case, EVE is just an observer, passively trying to measure something it has no influence over.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is presumed to have an internal *state*, an ordered set of numbers (a vector) which completely describes the part of the system we care about. We want to know this state, but it is hidden from us, and cannot be known directly. In the EVE example, the state is the actual UV flux on the Sun at a particular instant. On a robot, it is the current position and velocity of the vehicle.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We make a certain set of observations at one particular instant. Each of these observations is also a vector, but there may be more, less, or the same number of components as in the state. The observations help us learn about the state, but the observations are corrupted by measurement noise, and so do not perfectly describe the state. In the EVE example, the observation is the number of DNs (Data Numbers, the units of the raw value reported by an Analog-to-Digital converter) that the instrument records at a particular instant. A robot may use accelerometers, gyros, GPS, compasses, odometers, etc. This number may be calibrated into some physical unit, but still has an unavoidable amount of noise on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We take a vector of measurements at many different times. In the EVE example, the system measures the UV flux four times per second continually. A robot reads some or all of its sensors simultaneouslely, and each measurement is a component of the measurement vector for this time. The units of the components of the vector don't have to match, and the vector doesn't have to be the same measuremente each time. For instance, sometimes we will read our accelerometers and gyros and get a 6-element vector of measurements. Much less frequently we will read our compass and get a 1-element vector. Perhaps even less frequently we will read our GPS and get a 6-element vector, but different from that produced by our IMU.\n",

In this particular form of the problem, the system exists in some pre-determined state at some $i$, and then instanteaneously jumps to a new state at \\(i+1\\), where we measure it again. In any real system, the physics probably evolve over time, but as we will see, the filter math just doesn't care, and it is surprising how flexible this kind of \"time\" is. When we translate this all to code, we will find that $i$ is usually just a name, and we don't even have a variable representing $i$.

    "Normally I aggressively ignore history. In this case I can't, because a man's name is built into the name of the topic. If I just called it the \"sequential filter\" (as I have seen in textbooks occasionally) no one would know what I was talking about, and I wouldn't get any Google hits.\n",

    "Many people reached the New World before Columbus. The Vikings, the Nephites, the Jaredites, perhaps others, etc. However, Columbus is properly said to have discovered the New World, because his discoveries made it into modern main-stream thought, and all further exploitation of the New World is as a result of him and his journeys. He discovered the New World so well that no one ever needed to discover it again, and no educated person could credibly claim to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, through a phenomenon I have heard called ''Jungian simultaneity'', many people derived the formulas we now call the Kalman filter almost simultaneously. However, Rudolph Kalman's paper directly influenced the work of the guidance guys at MIT for the Apollo mission and perhaps other secret missions. Therefore, the filter is named after him by those who put it into practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rumor has it that Kalman met at a conference and discussed ideas with other people who wrote papers which also described the sequential filter. Who is to say whether the idea was original or not? I don't want to get into this controversy, which is why I would like to call it the sequential filter rather than Kalman filter, but for reasons described above, I can't.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why filter?\n",
    "Because it filters out noise from a measurement stream. The estimate stream produced by the filter can have much less uncertainty than the measurement stream coming in.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the amazing things about this filter, and estimation in general, is that it also filters out quantization noise. Under certain conditions, it is possible to get an estimate of the true state with less noise and uncertainty than any of the measurements that went into it. Ponder that deeply. The filter makes it possible to talk about fractions of a DN, about the space between the symbols produced by your ADC."

We don't know the error, but we do know the uncertainty, so we can talk about the covariance of the residual. Therefore there is a component of residual uncertainty caused purely by the uncertainty in our state estimate. The total residual uncertainty can't possibly be smaller than this. We also know that the measurement is imperfect, since we have *its* covariance $\\M R$.

If $K_i$ was one, we would end up with $x_i=x^-_i+z_i-x^-_i$, which means that the old estimate completely cancels out and the new estimate is just the new measurement.

It has all the statistical properties that you want, and if you tell the truth about all the filter inputs, the filter output really is optimum.

    "Naturally our uncertainty is a lot worse, since the filter thinks that the process really is uncertain about what its state is. It weighs the previous estimate quite a bit less than it did when the process was rock solid. Also notice that with this particular seed, we are unlucky with the last few measurements. There is a bias below the actual value, and as a result the estimate is about 1.8 sigma away from the truth. Not great, but not impossible.\n",

    "Process noise represents our uncertainty about what the process really is doing, uncertainty about our model. But, how can you assign a standard deviation to \"maybe the constant has a step in it\"? It certainly doesn't have a normal distribution. The right answer is to fix the process model, but maybe we can't. In this case, we use the process noise level as just a tuning parameter. We can tune it to get the right balance between noise filtering and responsiveness to change. In the above examples, the process noise is rather large, only 1/sqrt(10) of the measurement noise (Q=0.001, R=0.01). Let's see what happens as we turn the process noise down. All of these have the same measurement covariance, only the process covariance changes."

    "So we see that as we turn the process noise down, the estimate in the flat part becomes smoother, in exchange for the response to the new data becoming longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of tuning is a judgement call. It's actually an ugly hack, and should be avoided if possible, but it may not be possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Kalman Velocity Model\n",
    "Pay attention here, because we are finally going to develop something practical - The Kalman Velocity Model\n",
    "\n",
    "This is about the only problem I have found which both has a practical use, and actually fits the linear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine a rail car on a level frictionless rail. The car is unpowered and uncontrollable, but is subject to unpredictable accelerations (say from gusts of wind). We want to know the position and velocity of the car, but our only measuring device is a tape measure laid out along the track. Once again we can measure the position of the car to arbitrary position, but only finite accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's look at the process model again:\n",

    "\\vec{x}_i&=&\\M A\\vec{x}_{i-1}+\\vec{w}_i \\\\\n",
    "\\vec{z}_i&=&\\M H\\vec{x}_i+\\vec{v}_i\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we are considering motion, we need to consider time. The time interval between two measurements $\\vec{z}_{i-1}$ at $t_{i-1}$ and $\\vec{z}_i$ at $t_i$ we will call $\\Delta t=t_i-t_{i-1}$ (Delta-t). It doesn't matter if $\\Delta t$ is constant from step to step, but it is meaningless to think of $\\Delta t$ changing in a single step. If we consider $\\Delta t$ to be constant, it means that we have equally-spaced measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The state of the vehicle is completely determined by its current position $p$, and velocity $v$, so its state vector is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{x}=\\begin{bmatrix}p \\\\ v\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The state transition matrix is two-by-two, since the state is two-element. In simple linear equation language, we have this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "p_{i}&=&p_{i-1}+\\Delta t &v_{i-1}\\\\\n",
    "v_{i}&=&                 &v_{i-1}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray*}$$\n",

    "Converting this to a matrix equation gets us this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",

    "\\vec{x}_i&=&\\M A&\\vec{x}_{i-1}\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\M A=\\begin{bmatrix}1 & \\Delta t \\\\ 0 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For the observation matrix, we are taking the two-component state and converting it to one measurement, so the matrix is one-by-two.\n",

    "\\vec{z}_i&=&(1)p_i+&(0)v_i \\\\\n",

The process noise is a random vector variable with two elements, so its covariance is a two-by-two matrix. I will borrow the process noise model from Wikipedia. In between any two measurements, the unknown process noise acceleration is presumed to be constant $a_i$. Since it is unknown, we model it as a Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation $\\sigma_a$. By integrating this over the time step, we see that the velocity is changed by $a_i\\Delta t$ and by integrating twice we see that the position is changed by $\\frac{1}{2}a_i\\Delta t^2$.\n",

    "### Sensor fusion and sensor anti-fusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this  simple model, we have only one kind of sensor, for position, but we are able to recover both position and velocity. This is possible because our physics model $\\M A$, simple as it is, is complete and captures the whole state vector. It also passes the *observability* criterion, a concept for another day. \n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is important. If your system is observable (and that can be determined solely by looking at $\\M A$ and $\\M H$), you don't necessarily need a sensor for every component of your state vector. This is sensor anti-fusion, I guess. It is a complementary concept to sensor fusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "With sensor fusion, sensors of two different types are used to measure the same parts of the state vector. We'll get into exactly how to do this in a later post, but let's just talk about goals for a moment. Suppose your robot has a 6DOF IMU and a GPS. You use the IMU for accuracy over short distances and times, and the GPS to keep things aligned with the real world, and keep the IMU from wandering off too far.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you are probably not going to measure the GPS and IMU at the same time. So, for some steps, perhaps most steps, the IMU measurement is available and the GPS is not. Other steps, the GPS is available and the IMU is not. Perhaps there are rare times when both measurements are taken simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you do in this case is use a different observation model, and therefore a different $\\M H$ depending on what combinations of sensors are available at a particular instant. When you use the IMU, you have an $\\M H$ (or actually the nonlinear equivalent of $\\M H$) which only uses the IMU. You also have the measurement uncertainty of the IMU in its own $\\M R$. When you use the GPS, you use a different $\\M H$. And, when both are available simultaneously, you could use an $\\M H$ that incorporates both. We'll see why we don't do that at a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the right $\\M H$ for each measurement and the right $\\M A$ (or its nonlinear equivalent as we shall see) for the physics, combined with the correct measurement noise for each measurement, the filter does all the bookkeeping and weighting automatically to incorporate multiple different kinds of sensors into the same estimate. It automatically weights each measurement to use it as best as possible. If you don't lie with $\\M R$, it is able to weigh things appropriately without any further intervention. This is what is meant by sensor fusion."

    "### Testing your filter\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you are a much better programmer than me, and I don't think you are, when you originally code this up, it is going to have bugs. Now the normal way to debug is to trace the program flow, and at every line, or at least every critical line, *predict* what the program is going to do then test it by letting it execute. However, if you don't understand the algorithm, how can you do this prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why we are going step by step, with gradually more elaborate filters, each built off the last. I gave Python code for a scalar Kalman filter in a previous section. This simplest filter was devolved to the point that all the magic in equations 3 and 5 has been distilled out, leaving only an obvious averager. Then, as you add refinements one at a time, test frequently. When it breaks (and it will) you know what part is broken: the last one you added, or at least an interaction between that part and the rest of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to work with the code to understand it, and the best way is to evolve the code a step at a time as I have. You are guided by the examples, but you put in the effort yourself to follow them. It's all very Socratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no excuse to not have Python -- it is free and exists for every major (and many minor) platforms out there. However, if Python is not your favorite language, you can program the simpler models even in a spreadsheet, and the more complicated one in your favorite data-handling language, or even general purpose language like C, Java, or Perl. If your language has no native charting abilities, have your filter write its output into a CSV, then suck it into a spreadsheet. There's no excuse, as C, Java, Perl, and OpenOffice are all free for the taking and available on almost all platforms (even your robot, if you write in C).\n",
    "\n",
    "As you progress, you will come to the point where you will write a general Kalman filter function, which can handle any process model thrown at it. At this point, you will then be debugging your models. Before you try to debug on your robot, try using $\\M A$ and some initial conditions to simulate a robot trajectory and using $\\M H$ to generate measurements at frequent intervals. This way, the normally unknowable True State is in fact known, and you can compare your estimate with the Truth, in a way which is almost impossible otherwise."

    "### The usefulness of this model\n",
    "\n",
    "By itself, we can use this model to estimate the rate of change of any variable that we can measure. If you have a thermometer, you can use the filter to not only reduce the measurement noise, but also create out of thin air a measurement of the rate of change. Likewise the voltage and charge state of your battery, the altitude and climb/sink rate measured by an ultrasonic pinger used as an altimeter, or any number of things.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, when I describe the nonlinear filter and IMU model, you will see this model embedded in that one. The filter will integrate the acceleration to get velocity and position, but the acceleration it integrates will not be the direct measurement of the sensor, but an estimate based on the linear velocity model."

    "# Sensor Fusion\n",
    "There is nothing that says that our problem definition matrices, $\\M A$, $\\M H$, $\\M Q$, and $\\M R$ have to be constant from one step to the next. They have to be constant in one step, but they can be different in the next step. In fact, the *measurement size* $m$ doesn't even have to be constant. Suppose we have a cart model like above, but now we do have a direct speed measurement (like from a [flyball governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centrifugal_governor) attached to an encoder). \n",
    "\n",
    "If the two measurements are always taken in sync, then $m=2$ and we use an $\\M H$ matrix which is $(2 \\times 2)$ to determine both the position and velocity measurements from the state vector. In this simple case, $\\M H$ probably is just the right-sized identity matrix, but there is no reason to not have off-diagonal terms in the general case.\n",
    "\n",
    "If however, the measurements are not taken in sync, we do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Do a time update to the time of the next measurement, whichever it is.\n",
    "2. Do a measurement update for that kind of measurement. If for instance the position is currently being measured, we use $\\MM{H}{_p}=\\begin{bmatrix}1 && 0\\end{bmatrix}$, while if we have a velocity measurement, we use $\\MM{H}{_v}=\\begin{bmatrix}0 && 1\\end{bmatrix}$. In the first case, we use $\\MM{R}{_p}=[\\sigma_p^2]$, while in the second case we use $\\MM{R}{_v}=[\\sigma_v^2]$. Both of these are scalars.\n",
    "3. If the measurements happen at the same time, we can bump $m$ up to 2 and use our full-blown $\\MM{H}{_{pv}}$. In this case, $\\M R$ is 2x2, the on-diagonal components are the uncertainty of each component by itself (quantified as the variance $\\sigma_p^2$ and $\\sigma_v^2$). The off-diagonal components are the covariance between each component, in this case a single value $\\rho_{pv}\\sigma_p\\sigma_v$. But, unless we know otherwise, it is pretty typical to assume that the measurement errors in position and velocity are uncorrelated, $\\rho_{pv}=0$, and therefore all the off-diaogonal components of $\\M{R}$ are zero."

    "## Component-wise measurement update\n",
    "In order to calculate the Kalman gain, we need a matrix inverse. These require a bunch of code, a bunch of time, etc. In Python, that's not a big problem because we generally use Python on big computers with lots of power, and the bunch of code is already tucked into our linear algebra library (probably Numpy). So if you need to do it, it's possible, but note that the effort scales roughly by the size of the *cube* of the measurement vector $m^3$\n",
    "\n",
    "But, let's take a closer look at the part where we need it:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray*}\n",
    "\\MM{\\Gamma}{_{(m\\times m)}}&=&\\MM{H}{_{(m\\times n)}}\\MM{P}{^-_{i,(n\\times n)}}\\MM{H}{_{m\\times n}}^T+\\MM{R}{_{m\\times m}}\\\\\n",

    "\\end{eqnarray*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's all spare a thought for those lucky people who have a scalar measurement, IE $m=1$. Their $\\M \\Gamma$ matrix is a scalar, and inverting a scalar is just division. They don't have to do a matrix inverse at all. If only we could be one of those lucky people...\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we can't be that lucky is that in general, there is no way to divide the problem up into scalar measurements, because we have a full-blown $\\M R$. But, what if the components of our measurement vector are not correlated? In this case, all of the off-diagonal components are zero. We *can* treat each component as its own scalar measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this is a restriction on the problem -- in full generality, $\\M R$ is not diagonal and we will have to do a matrix inverse. However, the correlation between components of the measurement are typically difficult to measure, and we assume (maybe without justification) that the off-diagonal components of $\\M R$ are zero. We just assume away the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you have a measurement with $m$ components, you can do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Time update as normal\n",
    "2. Measurement update. For each component $i$ of the vector, do the following:\n",
    "   * Figure $\\MM{H}{_i}$ by taking row $i$ of the full matrix $\\M H$. The result will be an $1 \\times n$ matrix, or an $n$-element row vector.\n",
    "   * Figure $R_i$ (which will be a scalar now) as $\\sigma_i^2$\n",
    "   * Calculate $\\Gamma_i$ (which will be scalar now)\n",
    "   * Calculate $\\MM{S}{_i}$ which will be a $n \\times 1$ matrix, or a column vector\n",

    "This almost seems too good to be true, as each time, we are updating the whole state with a single component of measurement. What if the state is not observable with the one measurement? Suppose you have a system where the system is not observable given any one state, but is observable with all of them. Does this update work? \n",

    "I think that you can prove that it does, because the large matrix multiplies that we are doing for the large system are themselves composed of row operations. I will make the case that we are just explicitly doing the row operations that would be done automatically with the larger operations, and that the combined result of all of our measurement updates will be observable even if each row by itself is not, given that the large matrix measurement update is observable."
