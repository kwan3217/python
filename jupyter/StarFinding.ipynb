    "# Problem Statement\n",
    "The Voyager project supported a visualization effort led by Jim Blinn. This produced a number of simulated videos of the mission, including one which shows the interplanetary trajectories of both spacecraft. I call this video the \"supertrajectory\" after the name of the kernel used.\n",
    "\n",
    "I want to do a remaster of this video, to the point where Jim himself wouldn't be able to distinguish, except for being in HD. I want it to be a drop-in replacement for the original video from the 80s. I am using POV-Ray as the hammer to squash a flea, but I need exact camera parameters and pointing to do it right. Fortunately, the Blinn videos have an accurate starfield behind them, and since I have a catalog of all the bright stars, I can find and track the stars. Then, I just need a star camera algorithm...\n",
    "\n",
    "The best copy of the supertrajectory that I can find online is on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNf9BPTjvYo). I have downloaded that video and parsed it into files:\n",
