    "This is the simplest form of the orbit determination problem I learned this filter on back in school. A satellite is in orbit around a point mass. Newton's gravitation applies. The satellite is tracked from a radar at a fixed point above the point mass (or on the surface of a perfectly smooth, homogeneous, radar-transparent planet) in the plane of the satellite orbit. The point mass is so much heavier than the satellite that we may treat the satellite as a test mass. This means that the gravity of the satellite does not significantly move the central mass, and therefore the mass of the satellite cancels right out of the problem."

    "Next, we set up the initial guess and noise estimates, then call `ekf_loop()` to actually run the Extended Kalman filter. It takes a lot of parameters, but none of them are complicated. The hardest part is just passing them in the correct order. If you have a whole bunch of measurements in a block that you want to do, this is the way to go.
