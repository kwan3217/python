    "This is the simplest form of the orbit determination problem I learned this filter on back in school. A satellite is in orbit around a point mass. Newton's gravitation applies. The satellite is tracked from a radar at a fixed point above the point mass (or on the surface of a perfectly smooth, homogeneous, radar-transparent planet) in the plane of the satellite orbit. The point mass is so much heavier than the satellite that we may treat the satellite as a test mass. This means that the gravity of the satellite does not significantly move the central mass, and therefore the mass of the satellite cancels right out of the problem."
