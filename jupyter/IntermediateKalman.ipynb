    "If you know calculus, great. If not, stop now, and run, don't walk, to your library or bookstore and beg, borrow, or buy a good calculus book. I recommend [Calculus the Easy Way](http://books.google.com/books?id=7fTV6dm2mM0C&lpg=PP1&dq=calculus%20the%20easy%20way&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false) by Douglas Downing. Come back when you understand what a derivative is, and know how to calculate some easy ones. Also at least know what an integral is, even if you don't know how to calculate any, and read about the fundamental theorem, which basically states that a derivative can be reversed and that it is useful to do so. Knowing at least a smidgen of calculus will serve you long after your robot has decided to take a swim in the pond. It opens up a whole new world of problems and solutions, and that is useful for you to have a feel for whether a problem is solvable even in principle, even if you don't know how to solve it.\n",

However, for down-to-earth things like robots, the physics are usually too complicated to integrate directly. One of the things our filter will do for us is integrate numerically, so that we end up with (in principle) a list of times and the state vector for each time. This will be our trajectory function."

    "Nonlinear problems are hard. In fact, they can't be done. So instead, we do a modified problem and hope that it is close enough. This is the part where everyone goes off on Taylor series and such. I will just talk somewhat informally.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, most physical processes are smooth. No discontinuities and no corners. Just nice sweeping curves. If you look at any of these curves closely enough, the relative radius of curvature gets bigger and bigger, and any small section eventually appears linear if you zoom in on it enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to take advantage of this, you have to look at the right part of a curve. We need a reasonably accurate initial condition and a correct dynamics and kinematics model. Now we can use the derivative of the curve to find the general direction of motion. We use the initial condition estimate and model to create a reference trajectory. We end up not estimating the trajectory directly, but the divergence from the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we need a replacement for $\\M A$ and a way to update $\\hat{x}_i$ and $\\MM{P}{_i}$. The state vector is the easiest, so we'll talk about that. We know the physics model (If we don't, go find it!) so we can use it directly on our old estimate with numerical integration. I'll talk in detail about numerical integration in another post, but if you are a programmer, there is a good chance you have already written one. The simplest one is this simple:\n",

    "Replacing $\\M A$ is a bit harder. Skipping all the justifications and derivations, you need a physics matrix $\\M \\Phi$. Finding it will require cranking out a bunch of derivatives by hand or computer, or writing a numerical differentiator. Then with $\\M \\Phi$ in hand, you can numerically integrate to get $\\M A$. This is the \"linearization\" process talked about in textbooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix $\\M \\Phi$ is a Jacobian matrix, a kind of vector derivative. Instead of taking the derivative with respect to time as you may be accustomed to, you take the derivative of each component of the physics function with respect to each of the other components. You end up with a matrix, where for each cell, you have the derivative of the component that is this cell's row number, with respect to the component that is this cell's column number. If you want to, you can think of it as fitting tangent hyperplane to the physics function, in the same way that an ordinary derivative fits a tangent line to a 1D function. This hyperplane is flat, so this is why we call it \"linearized\". We then project this hyperplane out as far as we need it, and use it to transform an identity matrix from one place on the trajectory to $\\M A$ on another. The math is pretty straight forward, it's just hard to imagine, especially with more than about 1 element in your state vector.\n",

    "\n",
    "Time for an example. We'll start really really simple, and just redo the linear velocity model.\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, state vector. Basically the state vector is all the things that the system \"remembers\" about itself. Think about it as a simulation. Once we have a program, we run the simulation and freeze it at a certain point. What do we need to save so that when we restore, we have enough data to start the simulation back up? We'll use the cart on rails model as an example. We are working with a massive cart on smooth, level, perfectly frictionless rails. Therefore the cart is free to move in one dimension only. The very meaning of one dimension is that it takes only one number to describe the position, and we will call this number $p$. If we think of it as a function of time, we might say $p(t)$. We need $p$ in our state vector, but this does not yet completely describe the state. We also need to know the velocity. A cart at 4m down the track stopped is very different from a cart at 4m moving at 50m/s. As it turns out, this is all we need to know. This is all the cart \"remembers\" - everything else, such as our random gusts of wind, are instantaneous only. Any effect they have is only through changing the position and velocity. Therefore, $\\vec{x}=\\begin{bmatrix}p & v\\end{bmatrix}^T$. Our state vector has two elements, $p$ (in units of meters from the origin, positive on one side and negative on the other) and $v$ (in units of meters per second, positive if moving one way and negative if the other).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, physics. We actually use Newton's first law here (normally problems start with the second law). The cart has no forces applied to it, so it continues in a straight line at constant speed. The derivative of the speed is zero (this is what constant speed means) and the derivative of the position is the speed, so we end up with this:\n",

Note that we don't use $?_0$ which would be conventional math notation, because that conflicts with our use as a step index. So, for our state vector $\\vec{x}$ above, we can talk about $x_p$, $x_v$, and note that $x[0]=x_p$. Vector components always have an order, but sometimes it is more clear to talk about the components by name if any, so I will freely use both notations. When I get to it, I will number matrix cells with two indexes, row first, then column, starting at 0. So, the upper-left cell of any matrix $\\M ?$ is $?[0,0]$.)\n",

Since this variable doesn't even occur in the formula, the derivative is zero and we have $\\Phi[0,0]=0$. Next, in the upper right $[0,1]$ cell, we have component zero of the force function $F[0](\\vec{x})=x_v$ still, but this time we are going with respect to the 1 component of the state vector $x_v$.

    "Hmm, not so good. The estimate starts lagging behind the truth, and never catches up. This is more because the model doesn't fit the actual cart (which in this case has a rocket on it which lights at $t$=5sec). If the model could not be improved, then we will have to sacrifice smoothness and increase the process noise. In this form, we had an arbitrary $\\M Q$, which wasn't physically derived. We will try a different (larger) $\\M Q$ which is derived from the sigma-acceleration model used in BeginnerKalman."
